# Project 1: Expense Reimbursement System
## Project Description
The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can log in and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

• All tables must be in at least 3rd Normal Form.
• The back-end system shall use JDBC to connect to a PostgreSQL database, hosted on AWS RDS.
• Use at least one PreparedStatement or CallableStatement
• The application shall deploy onto a Tomcat Server.
• The middle tier shall use Servlet technology for dynamic Web application development.
• The front-end view will use JavaScript and AJAX to call server-side components. The web pages should look presentable (utilizing a combination of CSS and Bootstrap)
